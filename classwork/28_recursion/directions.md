## Exercise 1

Assume n is a positive number. Do not use remainder %. Instead think of the simplest two cases (base cases), and how can all other cases can get closer to the base case (recursive case).

Write the code and draw the call stack (upload an image of your call stack).

Save the code and an image of the call stack in the classwork directory:

`.../APCSA_1/apcsa-assignments-YourUsername/classwork/28_recursion/Even.java`

```
public static boolean isEven(int n){
}
```

## Exercise 2

Given an array of integers. Find the sum of all the elements in the array.

Write the code and draw the call stack (upload an image of your call stack).

Save the code and an image of the call stack in the classwork directory:

`.../APCSA_1/apcsa-assignments-YourUsername/classwork/28_recursion/SumArrayRecursion.java`

```
public static int sumArray(int[] nums, int index){
    
}
```
