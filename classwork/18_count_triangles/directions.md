## Count Triangles

Save here: ```.../APCSA_1/apcsa-assignments-YourUsername/classwork/18_count_triangles/```

The file "input.txt" gives triangles side lengths, one triangle per line. Some values do not make a triangle.

In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side, but... 5 10 25? It is not a valid triangle.

Write a program that determine how many of the listed triangles are valid?
