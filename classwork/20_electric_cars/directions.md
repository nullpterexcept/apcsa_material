## Electric Cars

There is a superclass Car. In this exercise, we are going to create the Electric Car subclass so that we can override a few methods to update them to work for ElectricCars.

The Car class has a field called fuelLevel. It represents the number of gallons left in the tank of a regular car. We’re going to reinterpret it to mean the battery percentage left in an Electric Car. Since it’s an int, to use fuelLevel in the ElectricCar, you’ll first need to convert it to a percentage by dividing by 100.

The Car class is complete, but you need to complete the ElectricCar class as outlined in the starter code with comments.

Once complete, use the Driver to create both a Car and ElectricCar object and test these per the instructions in the Driver class.
